## Pricing

WAN 2.6 pricing is based on resolution and duration.

| Resolution | Credits/second | 5s video | 10s video | 15s video |
|------------|----------------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **720p** | 80 | 400 credits ($0.40) | 800 credits ($0.80) | 1200 credits ($1.20) |
| **1080p** | 110 | 550 credits ($0.55) | 1100 credits ($1.10) | 1650 credits ($1.65) |

**Example calculations:**
- 5s video at 720p: 80 x 5 = 400 credits
- 10s video at 1080p: 110 x 10 = 1100 credits
- 15s video at 1080p: 110 x 15 = 1650 credits
